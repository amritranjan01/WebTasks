        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks
        that are typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning
        and problem-solving. AI applications include advanced web search engines
        (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon,
        and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa),
        self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT
        and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such
        as chess and Go). Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic
        discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism
        followed by disappointment and loss of funding, but after 2012, when
        deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, there was a vast
        increase in funding and interest. The various sub-fields of AI research
        are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.
        The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge
        representation, planning, learning, natural language processing,
        perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence (the ability
        to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To
        solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide
        range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical
        optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods
        based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon
        psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields.

        The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been
        broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or
        capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display.
        The traits described below have received the most attention and cover
        the scope of AI research.

        A computer program can easily produce gibberish - especially if it has
        been provided with garbage beforehand. This program does something a
        little different. It takes a block of text as input and works out the
        proportion of characters within the text according to a chosen order.
        For example, an order of 2 means the program looks at pairs of letters,
        an order of 3 means triplets of letters and so on. The software can
        regurgitate random text that is controlled by the proportion of
        characters. The results can be quite surprising.
